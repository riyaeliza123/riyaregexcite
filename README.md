Installation

You can install the development version of riyaregexcite from GitHub with:

``` install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("riyaeliza123/riyaregexcite") ```

Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

{r example}
library(riyaregexcite)
## basic example code

What is special about using README.Rmd instead of just README.md? You can include R chunks like so:

{r cars}
summary(cars)

You'll still need to render README.Rmd regularly, to keep README.md up-to-date. devtools::build_readme() is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
